  ## Description
  
   Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

   This application allowing developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site has been developed completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. I am using MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
